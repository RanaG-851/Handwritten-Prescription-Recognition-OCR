# Handwritten-Prescripton-Recoginition-Model
  This project uses handwriting recognition to recognize the names of medicines from a doctor's prescription. This is done using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) developed using the Pytorch Framework and OpenCV.

## Getting Started
### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/RanaG-851/Handwritten-Prescription-Recognition-OCR.git
```
After downloading the repo, you have to download the datasets and models.                                                            
Dataset - https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/text                                                                          
Models - In Digit folder.

### 2. Requirements
The project is created using Python 3.6 with Jupyter Notebook
Main libraries (all required libraries are in [reqiurements.txt](reqiurements.txt):
* numpy==1.22.0
* opencv-python==4.5.5.62
* pillow==8.4.0
* scipy==1.7.3
* torch==1.9.1


### Run
With all required libraries installed and cloned repo, run `jupyter notebook` in the directory of the project. Then you can work on the particular notebook.
